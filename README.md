CWP2 code uses the LeoV-RT data to find the mass-to-light ratio of the Leo V dwarf galaxies. It normalises the spectra of each of the stars and finds their velocities, metallicities and signal to noise ratios for each, plotting their spectra both normalised and unnormalised with their velocities. It also calculates the mass-to-light ratio for the galaxy.

C2prob2 code uses the MilkyWaySats.txt data provided to create two aitoff maps of all the positions of the satellites in the Milky Way in both RA, Dec and Galactic coordinates, with different shapes depending on the boundary magnitude classification. 

Unfortunately however, I no longer have access to the data used in the code but it does display some of my python skills.
